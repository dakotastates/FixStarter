FixStarter
Rails Project. This is a CRUD app built with Rails. Users can post problems, post solutions to other problems, and vote for the best solution. They can see all problems but only edit and delete their own. The owner of the problem can delete and edit. If deleted, all solutions will be deleted regardless of who owns it. I also included a comment section and filter capabilies.

Install instructions
Run bundle install to install all required gems. Then run rails server and click on a link provided in your terminal.
